# Images columnary
Image photocopied from columnary. Could be read by OCR ones that is under control. 
Preffered image format would be a scanned image, not a photo: a true flat image can be read better with OCR
Still the remote update is happening with pictures. Despite there is a scanner.  Over a couple of years I'm back so could take care.
The current treasure and I stop after 2026. Just enough time to have all running in the cloud.
