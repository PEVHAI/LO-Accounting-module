# General purpose accounting for Home Owners Association in LibreOffice with QGIS. 

Legally the HOA takes care of the security, maintenance and provides support to members. 
Currently the HOA started with 68 (non-paying) members back in 2010. When charching a fee (for the streetlights electricity bill) in 2014, several non payers existed. 
In 2017 a change happened and I got involved. Fee where raised to 250 peso and a handfull (34) where paying. Barely enough to pay the electricity bill. Maintenance has been introduced in 2019
and one has been working to raise enough funds to appoint guards and workers. Finaly in 2023 enough has been raised from 103 member inhabitant to make a start but the collection efficiency 
is still very low. Not enough to have a fully manned security and maintenance team.
