The number of the PEVHAI members did grow from about 35 members in 2017 to 110 in 2024. Large part of the area is still not occupied or build. 
The payment of the members, to be duly done every month, is lagging behind quite a bit. Only 45% is paying  and mostly late.

Therefore the program was extended with help functions as status reports on the payment of the dues and fees.

Nextextension was a geographical representation. The maps are produced by QGIS, a FOSS program, extended with information on electrical poles etc. 
Maps are fast changing so the content of the maps will be regular updated. A good map, with all utilities mapped so the elected board officers could start planning projects for security and a clean area.
Support for projects is build into the spreadsheet. 

Also a report maker is implemented in the sheet reports. For every quarter a staement can be produced.
From the quartely reports a yearly report (as required) is generated.

The base list is not reproduced here for privacy reasons.
